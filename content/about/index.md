Welcome to my blog! I'm Ari, a software engineer living in Mexico City. I'll be writing about whatever strikes my fancy, but especially technology and philosophy.

My web presence includes [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AriZerner), [GitHub](https://github.com/ari-zerner), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ari-zerner/). I'm also happy to get emails at \<my first name\>@\<my last name\>.com.
