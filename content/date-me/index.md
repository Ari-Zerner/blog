Hello! I'm pretty new to this dating thing, by which I mean I've been in a few serious relationships, each of which started when a close lady friend and I started smooching, but I haven't gotten to know a new person through dates. I don't really know what I'm doing, but it's not too late to start figuring it out! I'm single after a recent {{< sidenote "amicable">}}My ex wrote a testimonial about me; check it out at the end of this doc.{{< /sidenote >}} breakup and living in the Bay, which means it's time to write a Date Me Doc. My goal for this document is to help my friends matchmake for me, or to give you the information to decide whether you're interested.

# You Shouldn't Date Me Because...

- I'm unemployed and live with my dad, although I'm working on remedying that.
- My job search is keeping me busy so I have limited free time.
