Already think we're a good match? [Skip to the end](#lets-match).

---

Hello! I'm pretty new to this dating thing, by which I mean I've been in a few serious relationships, each of which started when a close lady friend and I started smooching, but I haven't gotten to know a new person through dates. I don't really know what I'm doing, but it's not too late to start figuring it out! My goal for this document is to help my friends matchmake for me, or to give you the information to decide whether you're interested.

# I Am...

- A 28-year old man.
- {{< sidenote "Heteroflexible." left >}}My fuzzy attraction cluster in person-space centers on cis women and AFAB enbies, but doesn't rule out trans men or women. It doesn't seem to contain cis men; I hope to bi-hack eventually but I'm not currently trying.{{< /sidenote >}}
- Polyamorous, and it's important to me.
- Based in Berkeley, CA.
- A rationalist (but I repeat myself, in this Date Me Doc).
- 5'9" and 225 lbs {{< sidenote "at the time of writing." >}}I'm rapidly losing weight thanks to tirzepatide. Last updated: 2025-04-16{{< /sidenote >}}

# I Want...

- A casual relationship or friend with benefits.
- Lots of physical touch/intimacy.
- Interesting conversation and fun outings.
- Meetups 1-4 times a month, with daily-to-weekly texting in between.

- People [invite](https://partiful.com/e/muoWoqLic11SwZGejIyL) [me](https://partiful.com/e/6YQiAewbkBrWuwxJ5ZAo) [to](https://partiful.com/e/NdYVOEA6kVyMNYqWgzNm) [parties](https://partiful.com/e/UlENK3tNsrFT8XuO9AQw) because I'm fun to have around, and I'd love to take you with me.
- I'm a generous and devoted lover, sexually adventurous, and kink-friendly.

# Testimonial

Cynthia, my best friend / {{< sidenote "de-escalated partner" >}}Previous versions of this document called her my ex, and her testimonial was written from that perspective, but that label doesn't fit our ever-evolving relationship anymore. Ask me if you want more detail.{{< /sidenote >}} (that's her in the picture above), wrote a very sweet and detailed perspective of me. Read it [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wHnnPP9JF4-Yng60iZBIpNw7CVXaHU00ZRSltc_IxC0)!
