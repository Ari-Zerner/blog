# You Are Immortal
Time is written in its entirety, moments connected by deterministic physics. Information can never be deleted. The mark of your decisions cannot be unwritten, is implicit in the structure of the universe always and forever.

You cannot experience your death. In the quantum multiverse, you always survive somewhere. There is always a next moment of your experience. By induction, you will live forever.

# You Are Dead
Particles have no identities, and every particle of your body moves in every instant. In every Planck interval, you disappear. Eventually your every experience is forgotten, your decisions dissipated as thermal radiation.
