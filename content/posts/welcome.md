Hello and welcome to my {{<sidenote "demesne!">}}<b>demesne</b> (/dəˈmān/) <i>n.</i> the lands of an estate.{{</sidenote>}} This place serves several purposes:
- Sometimes I write about things. I especially recommend [Manifesting a Trading Career]({{<ref "manifest-trading-bootcamp">}}) and [School Mindset]({{<ref "school-mindset">}}).
- I'm currently looking for work as a software engineer, so if you're hiring, take a look at my [resumé](/resume).
- I'm also open to gig work as a [private chef](https://aricooks.com) in the San Francisco Bay Area.
- If you'd rather do your own cooking, have a look at the [recipes](/recipes) section.
- If you want to get in touch for any reason, I encourage you to [contact me](/contact)!
