Hello and welcome to my {{<sidenote "demesne!">}}<b>demesne</b> (/dəˈmān/) <i>n.</i> the lands of an estate.{{</sidenote>}} This place serves several purposes:
- Sometimes I write about things. I especially recommend [Manifesting a Trading Career]({{<ref "manifest-trading-bootcamp">}}) and [School Mindset]({{<ref "school-mindset">}}).
- I'm currently looking for work as a software engineer, so if you're hiring, take a look at my [projects](/projects) (or my [resumé](/resume) if you prefer).
- For some culinary inspiration, have a look at the [recipes](/recipes) section.
- If you want to get in touch for any reason, I encourage you to [contact me](/contact)!
