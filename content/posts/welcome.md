Hello and welcome to my {{<sidenote "demesne!">}}<b>demesne</b> (/dəˈmān/) <i>n.</i> the lands of an estate.{{</sidenote>}} This place serves several purposes:
- Sometimes I [write about things](/posts).
- I've built some [cool stuff](/projects) I want to show off.
- I'm currently looking for work in [software engineering](/resume), generalist ops, or wherever serendipity may lead me. Check out my [career values](/posts/my-career-values) to see if we're a good fit!
- I'm also open to gigs as a [private chef](https://aricooks.com) in the Berkeley Area.
- If you'd rather do your own cooking, have a look at the [recipes](/recipes) section.
- If you want to get in touch for any reason, I encourage you to [contact me](/contact)!
