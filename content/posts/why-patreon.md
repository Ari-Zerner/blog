I've been struggling to figure out how to make money lately. I used to be a software engineer, you see, but that line of work just isn't holding my interest these days. In my younger days, people joked about me being a robot. I'd always had a knack for pedantry, and while that rigid logicality sometimes held me back in matters of friendship, it made programming easy and fun.

In these last few years (really, as a cascading project over the last decade) however, I've gotten far more social. As I've poured my efforts into becoming gregarious and graceful, the parts of my mind that were thrilled by programming have withered. I haven't forgotten the skill, but it tends to feel like a chore now.

It hasn't all been for nothing, of course. The effects of my growing interest in people have been drastic. I find that I'm liked everywhere I go, and I'm blessed with a wide circle of friends. People speak highly of me, and are vocal about their appreciation for having me around. I bring good vibes, emotional support, and a steady upbeatness. My less-extroverted friends sometimes find themselves awed and/or baffled by the way my social battery seems to never run out.

My community brings me great joy in life, and I'm glad I've developed my social skills. However, I haven't yet figured out how to monetize my new flavor of [insanity](https://www.experimental-history.com/p/face-it-youre-a-crazy-person). I have full faith that I'll find a {{< sidenote "niche," >}}My leading contender right now is event planning. I'm intrinsically interested in making great parties happen, and a lot of the work involved is just knowing the right people and talking to them, which I love doing anyway.{{< /sidenote >}} but in the meantime, being broke sucks. I can't live where I want to, travel without depending on others, afford the luxuries I used to enjoy, or be spontaneously generous to my friends as I wish I could. Love is all I need, but it sure would be nice to have money as well.

Capitalism is set up to reward specialization, and I think it's a great system. Nothing about my situation is unjust; the incentives are working as intended, to push me to find ways to be more directly productive. However, I do believe I bring real value to people's lives, in a diffuse, non-professional manner. I also think, in this transitional period, I could do more of that with a little more money; an Uber here, an event ticket there, letting me show up more and bring my classic cheer.

That brings us to the title of this post: why I made a Patreon. The direct inspiration came when my friend [Aaron](https://x.com/ironlordbyron) bought me a ticket to Vibecamp. This was incredibly generous of him, I had a fantastic time at Vibecamp, and I'm very grateful. It also got me thinking. People like me, and my community includes some wealthy individuals. If one person showed me such generosity on the basis of enjoying my presence, perhaps others will too. They might want to claim some credit for the illegible value I provide, take interest in banking my {{< sidenote "goodwill," >}}I certainly owe Aaron a favor!{{< /sidenote >}} or simply feel a sense of noblesse oblige.

If someone wants to give me money, whatever their reason, I want to make that easy for them. With that in mind, I set up a Patreon to reduce the friction for anyone who wants to show their appreciation with financial support. I would never dream of gating friendship behind money, and thanks to family support I'm at no risk of finding myself homeless or hungry. I say this to make it clear that there is no dire need here. However, if you feel that I improve your life, and you're in a place of financial abundance, consider using some of it to make it easier for me to keep doing what I do.

Thanks for reading!
