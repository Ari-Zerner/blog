Servings: 6

Ingredients:
- Stale bread in 1-inch cubes (2 cups)
- Whole milk (1-1/4 cups)
- Eggs (2)
- Brown sugar (1/2 cup packed)
- Cinnamon (1 tsp)
- Vanilla extract (1 tsp)
- Salt (1/4 tsp)
- Golden raisins (1/2 cup, optional)

Directions:
1) Preheat oven to 350Â°F and grease an 8x8" baking pan.
2) In a large bowl, beat the eggs.
3) Stir in the milk, sugar, cinnamon, vanilla, salt, and raisins.
4) Stir in the bread cubes.
5) Spread mixture in the 8x8" pan.
6) Place the 8x8" pan in a larger pan and pour hot water into the larger pan to a depth of 1 inch.
7) Bake until a knife inserted halfway between the center and edge comes out clean, about 40 minutes.
9) Serve warm or cold.

Notes:
- Best topped with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.
- Use a bread that won't fall apart. Challah and brioche work well.
- To get stale bread, cut bread into 1-inch cubes and leave out in an open container for at least a day.
