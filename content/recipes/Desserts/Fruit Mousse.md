Servings: 5

Ingredients:
- Heavy cream (1 cup)
- Fruit puree of choice (1 cup)

Directions:
1) Beat cream until stiff peaks form.
2) Fold puree into cream.
3) Scoop into serving glasses and chill until set, about 3 hours.

Notes:
- Wine glasses work well for serving.

Some fruit purees that have worked well:
    Mango (~3 mangoes)
    Strawberry banana (~1/2 lb strawberries, 1 banana)
    Peach (~3 peaches)
    Plum (2-3 plums)

If you try with a different fruit, I'd love to hear about it!
