Servings: 32

Ingredients:
- White sugar (1 cup)
- Brown sugar (1/2 cup)
- Corn syrup (1/3 cup)
- Honey (1/3 cup)
- Water (1/3 cup)
- Baking soda (2 teaspoons)

Directions:
1) Line an 8x8" pan with parchment paper.
2) In a saucepan, combine white sugar, brown sugar, corn syrup, honey, and water.
3) Stir over low heat until sugar is fully dissolved.
4) Increase heat to medium until mixture reaches 270°F.
5) Reduce heat to low and maintain temperature of 270°F for 15 minutes.
6) Immediately remove pan from heat. Remove thermometer and let bubbles subside.
7) Sift and quickly stir in baking soda.
8) Immediately pour the mixture into 8x8" pan.
9) Allow to cool completely, then break into pieces.

Notes:
- My preferred method of breaking up the candy is to turn it over on a cutting
- board and hit it with a wooden spoon, using the parchment paper to catch crumbs.
