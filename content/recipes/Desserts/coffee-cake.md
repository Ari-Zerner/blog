Servings: 10

Ingredients:

Streusel:
- Walnut halves (1 cup)
- Ground cinnamon (1 tbsp)
- Brown sugar, packed (1/3 cup)
- Unsalted butter, chilled (1/3 cup)
- Flour (1/2 cup)

Cake:
- Flour (2 cups)
- Baking soda (1/2 tsp)
- Baking powder (1-1/2 tsp)
- Unsalted butter, softened (1 cup)
- Granulated sugar (1-1/2 cups)
- Eggs (2)
- Sour cream (1 cup)
- Vanilla extract (1 tsp)

Directions:
1) Preheat the oven to 325°F. Grease and flour a bundt pan. Set aside.
2) Make streusel: Combine all streusel ingredients in a food processor. Pulse until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
3) Make cake: Combine flour, baking soda and baking powder in a small bowl and gently whisk to combine. Set aside.
4) Place butter and sugar in a large bowl and mix on medium speed for 2-3 minutes or until creamy. Add eggs and vanilla and mix until incorporated.
5) Add half of flour mixture to butter mixture and mix. Beat in sour cream until incorporated and mix in remaining flour. Batter will be thick.
6) Pour half of streusel mixture in the bottom of the bundt pan and spread evenly. Add 2/3 of batter on top of streusel and gently level with offset spatula or back of a spoon.
7) Sprinkle remaining streusel evenly over batter and top with remaining 1/3 batter. Smooth top and bake for 50-60 minutes or until toothpick inserted in cake comes out clean.
8) Cool completely in pan and invert on serving tray when ready to eat.

Notes:
- Use full fat sour cream and grass-fed or European style butter for best results.
- Can also bake in a 9x13 pan at 325°F for 35-45 minutes.
- If no food processor, use pastry blender with chopped walnuts and room temperature butter.
