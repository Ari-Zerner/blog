Servings: 4-5

Ingredients:
- Ground lamb (1 lb)
- Red lentils (1 cup)
- Beef broth (2 cups)
- Crushed tomatoes (14.5 oz.)
- Olive oil (3 tbsp)
- Yellow onions (2)
- Garlic (3 cloves)
- Chili powder (1 tbsp)
- Paprika (1 tbsp)
- Crushed red pepper (1/2 tsp)
- Cayenne (1/2 tsp)
- Ground cumin (1 tbsp)
- Ground coriander (1/2 tsp)
- Dried oregano (1 tbsp)
- Salt (1 tbsp)
- Ground black pepper (1 tsp)

Directions:
1) Finely chop onions and garlic.
2) In a medium pot, heat olive oil over medium heat.
3) Add garlic and onions and sauté until onions are transparent, 2-3 minutes.
4) Add chili powder, paprika, red pepper, cayenne, cumin, and coriander. Sauté 2
   minutes more, stirring constantly.
5) Add lamb and stir and mash constantly with a wooden spoon to break it up into
   very fine particles, until evenly browned, 5-7 minutes.
6) Stir in lentils, broth, tomatoes, oregano, salt, and black pepper.
7) Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally,
   until lentils are tender and chili is thick, (~45 minutes), adding some water
   to pot if lentils absorb all liquid before chili is done.

Notes:
- Best served with naan.
