Ingredients:
- Italian sausage without casing (1 lb)
- Yellow onion (2 medium)
- Garlic (2 cloves)
- Pasta sauce (26 oz)
- Frozen ravioli (25 oz)
- Shredded mozzarella cheese (1-1/2 cups)
- Shredded parmesan cheese (1-1/2 cups)

Directions:
1) Preheat oven to 350°F.
2) Chop onion and mince garlic.
3) Sauté sausage, onion, and garlic over medium-high heat until sausage is no longer pink.
4) Remove from heat, drain grease, and stir in pasta sauce.
5) In a 13x9" baking dish, spread just enough sausage mixture to cover the bottom.
6) Arrange half of the ravioli on top and evenly sprinkle with half of each cheese.
7) Top with remaining sausage mixture, ravioli and cheese.
8) Cover with foil and bake for 50 minutes.
9) Remove foil and continue baking for 10 minutes.
10) Let stand for 15 minutes before serving.

Notes:
- You can use whatever kind of ravioli you like. Cheese and mushroom are both fine choices.
- This recipe is relatively easy to make and tastes decent but not great.
