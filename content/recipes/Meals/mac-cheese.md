Servings: 5

Ingredients:
- Rotini (1 lb)
- Unsalted butter (1/4 cup)
- All-purpose flour (1/4 cup)
- Whole milk (2 cups)
- Shredded cheddar cheese (2 cups)

Directions:
1) Cook rotini according to package directions.
2) In a medium pot, melt butter over medium heat.
3) When butter is melted, add flour. Stir until mixture is smooth and golden.
4) Add milk and stir until mixture is smooth and bubbling.
5) Add cheese and stir until cheese is melted and mixture is smooth.
6) Stir rotini into mixture until evenly coated.

Notes:
This recipe is very flexible. Here are some modifications I've had success with. They can be used on their own or mixed and matched:

- Add 1 cup of frozen peas to pasta halfway through cooking it.
- Before melting butter, add 4-6 slices of bacon, chopped. When the bacon is cooked, add the butter.
- Before adding flour to the melted butter, sauté any combination of the following:
    - 1 clove of garlic, crushed
    - 1 onion, diced. This tends to flavor the whole dish with a sweet onion flavor.
      I find it overwhelms the other flavors, but if you like onion, this may be for you.
    - 2 handfuls of sliced baby bella mushrooms
- Separately sauté chicken and mix it in at the end.
- Serve garnished with any of the following:
    - truffle oil
    - black pepper
    - crushed red pepper
