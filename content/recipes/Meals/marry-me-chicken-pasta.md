# Ingredients

## Sauce Ingredients
- 1½ cups heavy cream
- 1¼ cup chicken broth
- ½ chicken bouillon cube
- 2 teaspoons honey
- 1 teaspoon hot sauce
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- ¾ teaspoons onion powder
- ¾ teaspoons dried parsley
- ¾ teaspoons dried oregano 
- ¾ teaspoons dried basil

## Other Ingredients
- 1 pound ziti
- 1 pound boneless skinless chicken breast
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- ½ cup dry white wine
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 2 tablespoons flour
- ⅓ cup oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, roughly chopped, reserving oil
- ¾ cup parmesan cheese, freshly grated
- ¼ cup cream cheese, softened
- 2 cups packed spinach

# Instructions
1. Combine the sauce ingredients in a large measuring cup with a spout and set aside.
2. Pat chicken dry. Cut into bite-size pieces and season with salt and pepper.
3. Heat reserved oil from sundried tomatoes (1-2 tbsp) in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and sauté until golden on all sides, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove and set aside.
4. Set salted water to boil for pasta.
5. Reduce heat to medium. Add the wine and use a spatula to "clean" the bottom and sides of the skillet. Simmer until liquid is reduced by half, 3 to 4 minutes.
6. Add the butter and the garlic and stir for 1 minute.
7. Add the tomato paste and the flour and stir for 2 minutes.
8. Add the sauce mixture (from step 2) in small splashes, stirring continuously.
9. Stir in the sundried tomatoes. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low.
10. Stir in the cream cheese and let it heat through and melt.
11. Simmer sauce partially covered while cooking pasta al dente according to package instructions. Drain once cooked.
12. Gradually sprinkle the Parmesan cheese into the sauce. Add the spinach and allow it to heat through for 1 minute.
13. Add the chicken along with any juices from the plate.
14. Taste sauce, then add salt and pepper as needed.
15. Gradually mix the pasta into the sauce.
