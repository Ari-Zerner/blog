Ingredients:
- Olive oil (6 tablespoons)
- Panko bread crumbs (⅔ cup)
- Salt and black pepper
- Yellow onion (1 medium), minced
- Garlic cloves (4), minced
- Crushed red pepper (½ teaspoon)
- Tomato paste (⅓ cup)
- Cannellini beans (2 14-ounce cans), rinsed and drained
- Heavy cream (1 cup)
- Chopped jarred sun-dried tomatoes in oil (½ cup)
- Finely grated Pecorino or Parmesan (⅓ cup + ⅓ cup)
- Baby arugula (3 ounces)
- Finely grated lemon zest (2 teaspoons)
- Lemon juice (4 teaspoons, from 1 lemon)
- Toasted bread (optional), for serving

Directions:
1) In a medium skillet, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat. Stir in panko and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until toasted and golden, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a paper-towel lined plate. Wipe out skillet.
2) Heat another 2 tablespoons olive oil in the skillet over medium heat. Add onion, garlic, and red pepper. Season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until softened, about 4 minutes.
3) Add tomato paste and stir until darkened and combined, about 3 minutes.
4) Stir in beans, heavy cream, sun-dried tomatoes, and ⅓ cup water. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until flavors meld, about 5 minutes. Stir in ⅓ cup of cheese, then season with salt and pepper.
5) In a medium bowl, toss arugula with the seasoned panko, lemon zest, lemon juice, ⅓ cup of cheese, and 2 tablespoons olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Pile the greens at the center of the bean mixture.
6) Serve with toasted bread, if desired.
