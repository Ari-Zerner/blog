Ingredients:
- Russet potatoes (2)
- Sweet potatoes (2)
- Vegetable oil (2 tbsp)
- Yellow onions (2 medium)
- Garlic (2 cloves)

Directions:
1) Peel and cube all potatoes.

6) Sauté the onions and garlic until the onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
7) Add the seasonings and ginger and sauté 2 more minutes.
8) Stir in the tomatoes, beans, peas, and potatoes.
9) Stir in the coconut milk and bring to a simmer. Simmer 5-10 minutes.

- Increase chili powder for a spicier curry if desired.
