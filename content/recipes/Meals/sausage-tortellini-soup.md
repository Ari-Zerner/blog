Notes:
- This recipe originally called for ground Italian sausage, but I've tried it with medallions of other types of sausage and that worked fine. Go with whatever you like/have on hand.
- You can use spinach instead of kale. If you do, add it just a minute before serving instead of at the same time as the tortellini.
