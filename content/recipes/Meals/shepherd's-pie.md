- Shredded cheddar cheese (optional)

Directions:

6) Sauté onions and carrots until onions are slightly translucent.
7) Add garlic and continue sautéing until onions are translucent and carrots are tender.
8) Add corn and peas and continue sautéing for 1 minute.
9) Add beef and cook until no pink remains. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
10) Add broth and Worcestershire sauce. Simmer uncovered for 10 minutes, then remove from heat.
11) Mash potatoes with 4 tbsp butter and salt and pepper to taste.
12) Preheat oven to 400°F.
13) Spread beef mixture into a 13x9" casserole dish.

15) Sprinkle cheese over potatoes.
16) Bake until bottom layer is bubbling and top is browned (~30 minutes).

Notes:
- Add other seasonings as desired when salt and pepper are called for.
- Something to try: use creamed corn, and layer it between beef and potatoes.
- For a healthier and flavorful option, use sweet potatoes instead of russet.
