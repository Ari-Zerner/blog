Servings: 8

Ingredients:
- Cubed stew beef (2 lbs)
- Yellow onion (1)
- Condensed cream of mushroom soup (10.5 oz)
- Condensed cream of onion soup (10.5 oz)
- Canned sliced mushrooms (8 oz)
- Black pepper (1/4 tsp)
- Cream cheese (8 oz)
- Sour cream (8 oz)
- Egg noodles (12 oz)

Directions:
1) (Optional) Brown beef in a skillet over medium-high heat.
2) Chop onion and drain mushrooms.
3) Mix beef, onion, soups, mushrooms, and pepper into slow cooker.
4) Cover and cook on high for 4 hours or low for 8 hours.
5) Stir cream cheese and sour cream into beef mixture until no chunks of cream cheese remain.
6) Keep warm in slow cooker while preparing noodles according to package directions.
7) Serve over noodles or stir noodles in before serving.

Notes:
- If you can't get cream of onion soup, replace it with cream of mushroom soup and add a second onion.
- I think this recipe could be improved by replacing the canned mushrooms with 1 lb of fresh sliced mushrooms, salted and sauteed to remove moisture before adding to slow cooker.
