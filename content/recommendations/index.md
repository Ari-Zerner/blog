Some stuff I enjoy(ed)! This page will always be a work in progress.

## Blogs

## Games

- [Magic: The Gathering](https://magic.wizards.com/en/): I've been playing Magic for most of my life and consider it to be the best tabletop game humanity has created. The online version, [MTG Arena](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgarena), makes it easier than ever to learn how to play.

### Roguelike Deckbuilders
Procedurally generated gameplay keeps things fresh, and meshes well with my Magic-driven fondness for deckbuilding. Consistently my favorite genre of videogame.

- [Slay the Spire](https://megacrit.com/): The OG roguelike deckbuilder. My most-played game on Steam, I can't recommend it enough.
- [Inscryption](https://www.inscryption.com/): A horror-themed roguelike deckbuilder with some twists.
- [Balatro](https://www.playbalatro.com/): A roguelike deckbuilder where your starting deck is an ordinary deck of playing cards.

### Puzzle Shooters
A nice mix of strategy and reflexes.

- [Hotline Miami](https://hotlinemiami.com/): Top-down 2D gameplay reminiscent of 80s arcade games. Gratuitously violent.
- [Superhot](https://superhotgame.com/): First-person gameplay where time slows down when you do. The most innovative shooter Iâ€™ve played in years!

## Books

- [Being You](https://www.anilseth.com/being-you/): An enlightening summary of the science of consciousness. Reviewed on [Putanumonit](https://putanumonit.com/2023/08/19/seth-explains-consciousness/).
- [Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat](https://www.saltfatacidheat.com/): A book that teaches principles of good cooking, rather than just a book of recipes.
