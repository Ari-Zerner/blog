### Profile

After three years developing the technical and communication skills needed to thrive as a software engineer, I embarked on a sabbatical in 2023 and reflected on my career. As I discuss in [School Mindset](/posts/school-mindset), I realized I had been going through the superficial motions of work rather than focusing on impact. As I re-enter the workforce in 2024 equipped with this understanding, I am excited to apply my expertise and agency to the fullest in order to deliver real value independently and in collaboration with smart and motivated teammates.
