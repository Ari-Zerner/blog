### Profile

"I worked as a tech lead with Ari on my team. He considers the problem he's solving as a whole when coming up with solutions, asking good questions. He doesn't have an ego; he's willing to talk through the tradeoffs of different ideas to settle on one, even if it isn't always what he proposed. Ari is pragmatic about his contributions, balancing maintainability with delivering value to the business. In addition, Ari is passionate about his craft; he cares deeply about learning and improving. Finally, Ari's a nice guy, and I greatly enjoyed working with him!" –Christopher O'Donnell, tech lead at OneStudyTeam
